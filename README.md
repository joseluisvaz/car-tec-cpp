Development of an autonomous vehicle prototype in ROS as the capstone project of the mechatronics engineering degree

## Overview
This repository is the ros-package needed for the capstone project for the degree in Mechatronics Engineering in the Tec de Monterrey - Campus Guadalajara.

This project is going to be the platform for several projects about autonomous systems on-campus and will lead to further development in the classes of Robotics and Capstone Project in Mechatronics Engineering.

This packagae has been developed and tested under:

**- ROS Kinetic**
**- Ubuntu Xenial 16.04**

Requirements:
**- Python: 3.5.2**
**- OpenCV: 3.4.0**

**Author(s): Jose Vazquez (Main Developer), Farid Izar (xbox control node), Andres Gonzalez (xbox control node)**

**Mainteiner: TBA**

## MCU Software Repository
